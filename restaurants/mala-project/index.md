The dry pot here isn‚Äôt just spicy, but packed full of flavor. They have 3
difference spice levels, with the spiciest level being very hot but
tolerable. They have a large assortment of options to put in the dry pot,
ranging from meats to vegetarian options. My favorite ingredients are the
eye of round beef, potato noodles, konjac noodles, quail eggs, and choy sum.
It‚Äôs a great place to go with multiple people for a larger communal bowl to
share. They also have a long list of authentic appetizers to choose from. I
go at least once a month and sometimes once a week.
