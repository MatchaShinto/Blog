-   ✅Cold jelly - refreshing and mildly sweet

These cute jiggly bunnies are the tablespoon-sized versions of
the famous wobbly cat puddings. At around $3.50 each, you can get these
bite-size jelly snacks, or you can get the full sized ones for around $17. The
blue bunny was made with oat milk and butterfly pea, while the green one was
made with pandan. Other flavors they had for the larger sizes included matcha,
vanilla, cacao, and more.
